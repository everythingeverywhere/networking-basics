# To create both veth pair use the command:
sudo ip link add veth-pb type veth peer name bread-pb-veth

# To create an ip address for the jelly namespace with the ip address add command for the device jelly:
sudo ip netns exec jelly \
ip address add 192.168.0.55/24 dev veth-jelly

sudo ip netns exec jelly \
ip link set veth-jelly up
# Similarly, assign an address to pb as well
